This repository exists for a few reasons:
 - The erotic thriller is having a comeback
 - The release of the Grey Goose means drop order suddenly matters
 - we don't currently have drop orders spaded, probably
 - I still haven't seen Secretary (2002)
 - It is really annoying to actually spade this stuff, and we have a lot of passive data
